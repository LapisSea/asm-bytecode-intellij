# ASM Bytecode Outline *(Rebooted)*

This is a fork of the original Intellij Plugin that has been abandoned.

For any familiar with the old version from Eclipse or Intellij, it works the same as before, except the ASM has been updated as to support modern .class versions and the Intellij addon API has been kept up to date.
The only missing feature from the original addon is the cursor syncing. This may be implemented in the future or if anyone pokes me about it.

I am open to feature requests, but beyond this, the addon is mostly on maintenance mode.
The addon should work with the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA. If it does not, please open an issue about it! I may have forgotten to update it.
